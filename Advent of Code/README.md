## Overview

Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve daily coding challenges throughout December. Each day presents a new problem, often reflecting a festive theme. This repository contains my solutions to each day's challenges, as well as my reflections and learnings along the way.

## Getting Started

To run the Go solutions, ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can check your installation by running:

``` bash
go version
```
